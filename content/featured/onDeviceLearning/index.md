Development and implementation of an on-device, fully decentralised learning framework based on TensorFlow Lite aimed at mobile phones.

The framework enables a mobile device to train a deep neural network using TensorFlow Lite on-device training capabilities.

It uses the data stored on the phone for training. Aggregates the weights of foreign nodes locally and pushes the updated neural network back to a peer-to-peer network using Bluetooth.
