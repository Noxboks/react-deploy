- Focus on improving the reasoning capabilities of current deep learning models.
- Investigate the robustness of the recent “Transformer-encoder+Attention-decoder” model, which uses a Transformer applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem.
- Identify the potential type of adversial attacks the Transformer Neural Network applied to the TSP problem could be vulnerable to.
- Compare the performances of the most recent deep learning applications for the TSP problem against more traditional solver, such as Gurobi or Concorde.
